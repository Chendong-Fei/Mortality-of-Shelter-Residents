according to the bernulli distribution, simulate the next 20 years based on this dataset

ChatGPT
To simulate the next 20 years using a Bernoulli distribution for specific columns, we would focus on binary events (success/failure) or the presence/absence of specific outcomes. For the dataset at hand, using a Bernoulli distribution might apply best for predicting the occurrence of deaths in categories like male, female, or transgender/non-binary/Two-Spirit decedents. This approach can help simulate whether a death occurs in these categories.

Below is an R code to simulate the next 20 years based on a Bernoulli distribution for categories like whether or not deaths occur in each demographic group, along with some modifications for total deaths and average ages.
